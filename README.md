# Sign-Up Form Project

## Introduction
This project is a part of Odin project curriculum. It is focused on building a sign-up form for an imaginary service using HTML and CSS. The goal is to create a fully functional, visually appealing form, incorporating various design elements such as a background image, logo, and custom fonts. In this project, I will apply modern web development techniques to build a form with proper input validation, styling, and a user-friendly interface. This will also serve as an excellent opportunity to practice structuring HTML content, using CSS for layout and styling, and enhancing the form's usability with input pseudo-classes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Cloning the Repository
To begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharat705/Sign-up-Form
```

### 2. Project Files
- `index.html`: This file contains the basic structure and elements of the form.
- `styles.css`: The main CSS file that styles the HTML elements, including inputs, buttons, and the overall layout.
- `assets/`: This folder should contain external assets like images and fonts used for the project.

### 3. Running the Project
To view the project in your browser:
- Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox).
- Ensure that all file paths for images, fonts, and stylesheets are correctly linked for the project to display as intended.

## Key Features
- **Form Design**: Includes a modern form layout with fields for user input, a “Create Account” button, and custom styling for invalid or focused inputs.
- **Background Image**: A large image in the background provides visual appeal and is styled with a semi-transparent dark overlay behind the logo for better text readability.
- **Custom Fonts**: The form utilizes an external font for branding elements, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the page.
- **Input Validation (CSS)**: Inputs for passwords are styled with pseudo-classes to display a red border when the input is invalid and a blue border with subtle shadows when focused.
